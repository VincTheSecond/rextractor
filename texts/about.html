<h2>Learn more about RExtractor</h2>

<p>RExtractor is a system that extracts a knowledge base from raw unstructured texts that is designed as a set of entities and their relations and represented in an ontological framework. The extraction pipeline processes input texts by linguistically-aware tools and extracts entities and relations from their syntactic representation. Consequently, the extracted data is represented according to the Linked Data principles. The system is designed both domain and language independent and provides users with data for more intelligent search than full-text search.</p>

<h3>Extraction strategy</h3>

<p>RExtractor consists of four compoments:</p>

<h4>Conversion</h4>

<p>A largely technical component converting various input formats into internal representation.</p>

<h4>Natural Language Processing</h4>

<p>A linguistic component providing various analyses of input texts, namely sentence segmentation, tokenization, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing. Currently employed procedures fit the framework originally formulated in the <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt3.0/">Prague Dependency Treebank</a> (PDT).</p>

<p>The dependency approach to syntactic parsing with the main role of verb is applied and it results in a dependency tree where each token in the sentence has one corresponding node and dependencies are assigned with the syntactic dependency relation. For illustration, assume the sentence <em>(3) Accounting units, which keep books in simplified extent, create fixed items and reserves according to special legal regulations</em>. Its dependency tree is displayed in following Figure:

<h4>Entity Detection</h4>

<p>An extraction component querying dependency trees to detect entities stored in Database of Entities (DBE) in texts and it exploits the <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pmltq/">PML-TQ tool</a>. DBE is built by domain experts. We prefer querying dependency trees to matching texts with regular expressions because it allows us to detect entities with more complex structures, like coordinations. Figure displays the dependency tree of coordination <em>current tangible and intangible assets</em>. Using the PML-TQ query displayed in the Figure, we detect the entity <em>current tangible assets</em> in the tree.

<p>Figure below presents entities detected in the sentence <em>(3) Accounting units, which keep books in simplified extent, create fixed items and reserves according to special legal regulations</em>:

<h4>Relation Extraction</h4>

<p>An extraction component querying dependency trees with highlighted entities to detect relations between them. It exploits the PML-TQ tool as well and poses queries stored in Database of Queries (DBQ). DBS is built by both domain and PML-TQ experts.</p>

<p>For illustration, assume the sentence <em>(3) Accounting units, which keep books in simplified extent, create fixed items and reserves according to special legal regulations</em>, its dependency tree and the query displayed in Figure:
<center><img src="images/entities.svg"></center></p>

<p>Table below lists data extracted from the given tree by the given query:
<center>
<table class='list'>
    <tr>
        <th>Subject</th>
        <th>Predicate</th>
        <th>Object</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><em>Entity</em></td>
        <td><em>hasToCreate</em></td>
        <td><em>Something</em></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accounting units</td>
        <td>crate</td>
        <td>fixed items</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Accounting units</td>
        <td>crate</td>
        <td>reserves</td>
    </tr>
</table>
</center>
