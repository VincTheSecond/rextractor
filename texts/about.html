<h2>Learn more about RExtractor</h2>

<p>RExtractor is a system that extracts a knowledge base from raw unstructured texts. The base is designed as a set of entities and their relations and is represented in an ontological framework.

<p>The extraction pipeline processes input texts by linguistically-aware tools and extracts entities and relations from their syntactic representation. Consequently, the extracted data is represented according to the Linked Data principles. The system is designed both domain and language independent and provides users with data for more intelligent search than full-text search.

<p>RExtractor consists of four compoments:

<ol>
    <li>
        <b>Conversion</b>
        -- a largely <i>technical component</i> converting various input formats into an internal representation.<br><br></li>

    <li>
        <b>Natural Language Processing</b>
        -- a <i>linguistic component</i> providing various analyses of input texts, namely sentence segmentation, tokenization, morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing. <br><br>
        Currently employed procedures come from <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/treex">Treex</a>, a highly modular NLP software system. The NLP component outputs a dependency tree for each sentence in the input texts. For illustration, assume the sentence <em>(3) Accounting units, which keep books in simplified extent, create fixed items and reserves according to special legal regulations</em> and its dependency tree (for more details on dependency trees, see <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/doc/pdt-guide/en/html/ch02.html">PDT guidelines</a>, Section 2.1 and 2.2):

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <b>Entity Detection</b>
        -- an <i>extraction component</i> querying the dependency trees to detect entities stored in Database of Entities (DBE). It exploits the <a href="http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pmltq/">PML-TQ</a> tool. DBE is built manually by domain experts.
        <br><br>
        We detect the entity <em>current tangible assets</em> in the tree on the left using the PML-TQ query on the right:

        <center><img src="images/entities_detection.svg"></center>
        <br><br>
        The figure below presents entities from DBE detected in the sample sentence:

        <br><br>
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Relation Extraction</b>
        -- an <i>extraction component</i> querying the dependency trees with recognized entities to detect relations between them. It exploits the PML-TQ tool as well and poses queries stored in Database of Queries (DBQ). DBQ is built manually by both domain and PML-TQ experts.
        <br><br>
        For illustration, assume the tree above and a query on the figure below:
        <br><br><br>
        <center><img src="images/query.svg"></center>
        <br><br>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>To sum up, processing the sentence <em>(3) Accounting units, which keep books in simplified extent, create fixed items and reserves according to special legal regulations</em>, RExtractor builds a knowledge base consisting of three entities (<i>accounting unit</i>, <i>fixed item</i>, <i>reserve</i>) and the <i>sth/sb has to create sth</i> relation :
